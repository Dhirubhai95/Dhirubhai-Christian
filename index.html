          if you have an app that changes frequently and drastically with
          thousands of pages, it is better to use a modern Javascript framework.
          On the other hand, React which allows us to use reusable components
          and is capable of keeping the UI in sync with the state, can
          definitely solve this problem

          that, your JavaScript skills are what make you a better React
          developer. There are no barriers to entry. A JavaScript developer can
          become a productive React developer in a few hours\

          JavaScript is what is called a Client-side Scripting Language. ...
          When the browser loads the page, the browser has a built-in
          interpreter that reads the JavaScript code it finds in the page and
          runs it. Web page designers use JavaScript in many different ways. One
          of the most common is to do field validation in a form.

          Overview. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types
          and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is
          based on the Java and C languages â€” many structures from those
          languages apply to JavaScript as well. ... JavaScript programs
          manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type.
